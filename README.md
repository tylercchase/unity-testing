# Unity Testing

A project for learning about how unity and C# works.

The general idea for the game is something that lets you draw runes on a tablet (or in the air?) to complete spells to cast.

Taking inspiration from pokemon rangers, OrbusVR. 
The hope is to take this project and make it work in VR once I get some of the base functionality working.
